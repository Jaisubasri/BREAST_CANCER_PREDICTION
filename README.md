   SYNOPSIS

Breast cancer is a widespread and life-threatening disease, making early detection crucial for successful treatment outcomes. This project delves into breast cancer detection using mammogram images, employing a multifaceted approach that combines traditional machine learning algorithms with deep learning techniques.
The initial stage of the project involves the application of classical algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to analyze mammogram images. These algorithms are aimed at identifying distinct patterns and features that can serve as indicators of potential malignancies.
In parallel, deep learning models are harnessed for their capacity to automatically extract intricate patterns from images. Two convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, DenseNet and Inception, are employed to significantly enhance the accuracy of breast cancer detection. These deep learning models have the potential to identify subtle and complex features that might be missed by traditional methods.
The comparison of these diverse algorithms and models is central to the project, with the ultimate goal of advancing breast cancer detection. The research seeks to improve early diagnosis, thereby increasing the chances of successful treatment and reducing breast cancer-related mortality rates. This project represents a critical step in leveraging advanced technology to combat this life-threatening disease.
